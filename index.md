## Currently

I am a **PhD candidate** based at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professor Luigi Del Debbio.

I am also currently a part-time student working towards a [Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/postgraduate-certificate-academic-practice-pgcap), which means I spend a lot of my time teaching undergraduates and MSc students.

After finishing my PhD in April I will begin a short-term research contract with the School of Physics and Astronomy, which is expected to end in September 2024.


## Research Interests

Broadly speaking my efforts are always to practise thoughtful and responsible use of technology and data to solve the kinds of problems that matter to me, which are mostly themed around physics, education, the environment, and the future of work and creative activity.

The primary focus of my PhD research has been on the problem of [Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling](https://machinelearningmastery.com/markov-chain-monte-carlo-for-probability/) in [Lattice Field Theory](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Lattice_quantum_field_theory).
Specifically, I've been looking at how certain [Generative Machine Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-10-13-flow-models/) methods can mitigate the severe collapse in sampling efficiency known as [Critical Slowing Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_transition), which remains a significant barrier to Lattice QCD studies at fine lattice spacings.

I am currently spending a lot of time contemplating the promises and threats posed by [Generative Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) to formative learning experiences, such as undergraduates learning to code for the first time.
I have secured funding from the School of Physics and Astronomy to carry out research in this area over the summer.

I am very interested in the modelling and monitoring of the natural environment, and was fortunate to join the Coastal and Environmental Remote Sensing Group as a 'visiting' student, where I developed Remote Sensing and GIS skills under the supervision of Dr Encarni Medina-Lopez.
