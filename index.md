## Currently

I am a PhD candidate based at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/), University of Edinburgh.
I am primarily affiliated with the [Particle Physics Theory Group](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/particle-physics-theory), under the supervision of Professor Luigi Del Debbio.
I am also affiliated with the Coastal and Environmental Remote Sensing Group, under the supervision of Dr Encarni Medina-Lopez.


## Research

I am broadly interested in how modern computational techniques, such as Machine Learning, can be effectively utilised to solve diverse problems.
The main focus of my PhD research is to address the problem of sampling in [Lattice Field Theory](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Lattice_quantum_field_theory) using [generative models](https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/).
I also spend time thinking about strategies that would enable effective data-driven decision making in wider society.


### Active Projects
